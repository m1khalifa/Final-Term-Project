Abstract :

In this Paper Abalone data sets were used to classify Sex ( M, F and I) by classification task, and Regression tasks were used for age features (rings+1.5).
This paper applies several machine learning algorithms, and it has been found that the Naive Bayes algorithm is not suitable for this dataset as not a single feature follows the normal distribution.
The naive Bayes algorithm gives good results when data is normally distributed.
Logistic Regression and support vector machine algorithms give good accuracy as compared to other algorithms. A confusion matrix was used to check the accuracy after making the predictions
